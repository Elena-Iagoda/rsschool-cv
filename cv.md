## About Me
I work as an economist. But I have always been attracted to work in the IT field. I decided to radically change my profession. From many directions, I chose frontend development and started to learn JavaScript for myself.

I am a very assiduous and responsible person. I always push the matter through. If there is a problem along the way, I will solve it.

I enjoy learning new things and love sports. Furthermore, I spend all my free time with my family.
